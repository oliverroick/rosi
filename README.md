# rosi

ESRI's [ArcGIS API for Python](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/) does not support converting GeoJSON geometries into [ArcGIS geometries](https://esri.github.io/arcgis-python-api/apidoc/html/arcgis.geometry.html). That's what this library does: GeoJSON in â€“ ArcGIS geometries out. 


## Why the name _rosi_?

It's my grandmother's name and a pun on [Fiona](https://github.com/Toblerity/Fiona). I think it's funny.
